Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    I overloaded the three subclass constructors and hardcoded nFloors for all three overloads. I chose these because they are the only methods with multiple parameters and hardcoded nFloors because it was the only integer in the constructor.
    I overloaded the restock method in the Cafe Class so that a default amount can be retocked.
    I overloaded the constructors for library and house again and hardcoding everything but name and address.
    
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    reading through the README carefully is needed to fully understand the assignments and will help with figuring out exactly what to do
